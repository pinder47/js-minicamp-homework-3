# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
		-Objects are similar to arrays except that an object contains key/value pairs instead of a single value. Keys are always a string, and the value can be of any variable type. You can assign a function to a key by using an anonymous function.
	* Properties
		-Properties are the the individual key/value pairs inside of an object.
	* Methods
		-Methods are functions stored inside the object and can be accessed by using dot notation (e.g., object.method(); )
	* for in loop
		-A specific type of for loop that iterates over each element in an array, rather than while a specific condition is true.
	* dot notation vs bracket notation
		-Dot notation references a property in an object by the name of that property. Bracket notation references a property in an object by the key value of that property, or references an element in an array by the index number in the array.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
